Reading and Writing files
There are sevral commands (
    functions, methods
)
You can give to files within python. For now, this is a review of the most important ones. It's worth noting that not all of these will accept parameteres but that doesn't matter yet. The main takeaway here is that 'write' takes the parameter of the string we want to write to,
1. Close. closes file, acts as a save, in editor
2. Read. Reads the content of a file, csan assign result to a variable
3. Readline. Reads one line of txt file
4. Truncate. Empties file. be cautious.
5. Write. writes to file.
6. Seek (0). moves the read/write to the begining of the file.
